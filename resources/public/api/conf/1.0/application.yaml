  title: UKIM EORI Authorisaton Checker Reference Guide
  description: |
    This API allows Fast Parcel Operators (FPOs) and 3rd party users to check if the holders of provided EORI Numbers have a valid UKIM authorisation.
    The aim is to avoid possible rejections of goods moving through from GB-NI, which could physically stop the B2B parcels.
    The API is based on REST principles with a single GET method endpoint that returns data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes. 
    Use the API to request the UKIM Authorization Status of between 1 to 3000 EORIs passed as an array. 

    Note: The API endpoint relates only to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

        '400':
          description: |
            Validation failure. The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
        '403':
          description: |
            Forbidden. The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.
        '405':
          description: |
            Method not allowed. The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. 
        '406':
          description: |
            Not acceptable. This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.
        '429':
          description: |
            Request in excess of rate limit. The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.
        '500':
          description: |
            Internal Server Error. The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
