We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

- 200 if it succeeded

- 400 for Validation failure

- 405 for Method not allowed
        
- 406 for Not acceptable

- 429 for request in excess of rate limit
          
- 500 for Internal Server Error

Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our reference guide for more on errors.
