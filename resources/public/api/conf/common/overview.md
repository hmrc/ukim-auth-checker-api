# Overview
This API allows Fast Parcel Operators (FPOs) and 3rd party users to check if the holders of provided EORI Numbers have a valid UKIM authorisation.
The aim is to avoid possible rejections of goods moving through from GB-NI, which could physically stop the B2B parcels.
The API is based on REST principles with a single POST method endpoint that returns data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.
